# Path Planning Project: 8-Puzzle

Overview:\
This project solves the 8 puzzle problem using Breadth First Search algorithm. 

Libraries used:\
numpy: Converting list into arrays for better handling of data

Run:\
Open a terminal in the folder containing the code.\
Run the command:\
"python 8puzzle.py"\
You will be prompted to enter the digits row-wise, with a space between each digit\
i.e. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0\
After completion, the path to reaching the goal is printed on screen, along with the number of states explored.\
The text files are updated as well.
